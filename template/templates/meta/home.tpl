Humanity itself struck a blow against the Agents of Evil on the beaches of Normandy, battled it back through Italy, fought on the banks of the river Rhine, and finally walked the streets of Berlin. Peace and prosperity followed for many a year, and humanity has not known an event so terrible since.</p>
<p>This website has nothing to do with any of that. Welcome to these godless internets, a fearsome creature created by Al Gore and George Bush. This is but a humble imageforum from and for anon. Our goal is to provide a slightly more organized and civilized conversation than elsewhere.</p>
